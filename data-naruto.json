She stated she couldn't help as she was too old, she would rather just see her grandson. Baki countered that was convenient since the one who hurt Kankurou was that very same man. This stirred Chiyo to action. When she examined Kankurou she stated she could not help him but Tsunade could. Baki countered that Tsunade could not leave Konoha since she was the Hokage now, but that she had sent someone in her stead.\n\nWhen Temari, Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura arrived in Hidden Sand to help the village, Chiyo jumped to attack Kakashi. She mistook him for his father, Hatake Sakumo, the legendary White Fang of Konoha. Chiyo blamed Sakumo for the death of her son, apparently Sasori's father, though the number of Chiyo's sons in unknown. When her brother pointed out that Kakashi wasn't Sakumo, Chiyo tried to save face by saying she was just joking. Sakura managed to use her healing skills to save Kankurou. When Naruto and his team decided to head out to track down Akatsuki, Chiyo decided to tag along. She brought along a pair of mysterious scrolls which could be used to stop her grandson's schemes.\n\nOn their journey to save Gaara, Chiyo revealed she had sealed the Shukaku demon within Gaara.

It was then revealed Sasori had killed the Third Kazekage and would use him in battle as a puppet against Chiyo.\n\nChiyo then decided it was best to combat Sasori with the scrolls she had brought along. Chiyo used them to summon two puppets, Sasori's parents who had been made into puppets in the past. Sasori was amused by this and the parent puppets were eventually damaged. Sakura's strategy allowed her to destroy the Sandaime puppet, and her constant vigilance and assistance to Chiyo greatly impressed the older kunoichi. Chiyo was forced to pull out her ultimate technique, her ten Chikamatsu puppets which she had inherited from the first kugutsu no jutsu user.\n\nSasori in turn would use his legendary hundred puppet army. Chiyo focused on quality over quantity and with Sakura's help made destroyed the puppet army. Unfortunately in the process Chiyo became poisoned by one of the blades. Sasori was not finished though, escaping harm to his original puppet body, he moved to another puppet and moved to quickly kill Chiyo. Sakura jumped to protect Chiyo and took a poison katana through the stomach, critically wounding her. Chiyo was again moved by her actions, knowing their one remaining poison antidote was meant for herself, she instead gave it Sakura. She then did her final acts as a puppeteer, she quickly maneuvered the parent puppets back into the field of battle to pierce Sasori's chest container where his life essence was housed. After striking an apparent fatal blow, she turned to help Sakura.\n\nThe dying and immobilized Sasori mocked the two kunoichi but Chiyo revealed her final surprise, a reincarnation jutsu which would allow her to breathe life into the dead in exchange for her own life. A jutsu she was to have used on Sasori's dead parents as a gift to her grandson. Instead Chiyo used her powers to save the young woman who gave her life in battle to protect her, much to Sasori's amused sadness. After using her jutsu, the group were surprised by the fact Chiyo remained alive, she surmised it was because Sakura was not yet dead. Since he was defeated, Sasori gave Sakura information on Orochimaru. Chiyo then watched as her grandson fell to the ground, dead. She told Sakura she was not responsible for Sasori's death, he hesitated when the parent puppets came to strike, not moving to avoid them. Severely fatigued and weakened, Chiyo stated she still had more to do so the two kunoichi left to join the others.\n\nFinding the dead Gaara who had been rescued by Naruto, Chiyo used her jutsu one last time. Her final act of redemption was to give up the last of her life-force to Gaara, aided by the chakra of Naruto.

Gaining access to Hidden Sand, Deidara faced off against the village's Kazekage Gaara. As Deidara moved swiftly through the air on his clay bird, Gaara managed to surround his opponent in a huge sphere of sand to crush him. Deidara moved quickly but not quickly enough to escape the trap. Gaara managed to encase Deidara's left arm in sand and crush it.\n\nHurt but not out of the fight, Deidara used his ability to manipulate clay into explosive pieces of moving art. He was able to take in some of Gaara's gourd sand and imbue it with his highest form of explosive chakra, called C3. Unknowingly Gaara returned this imbued sand to near his body. Deidara sent a huge explosive towards Hidden Sand, forcing Gaara to use a massive amount of chakra to create a sand barrier to shield the village from the blast. Deidara used this opportunity while Gaara was weakened to detonate the C3 sand. Unable to protect himself, Gaara took the brunt of the blast and was defeated, falling into Deidara's and Akatsuki's control.\n\nDeidara would take Gaara to the River Country where Akatsuki would remove the Shukaku demon that was sealed inside him. When Naruto and his teammates arrived to save Gaara, they found the process completed and Gaara lifeless. Deidara and his partner Sasori then began to battle Naruto and his team. Sasori stayed behind while Deidara flew away on his clay bird with the lifeless Gaara. Naruto and Kakashi followed in pursuit and Kakashi revealed his long range attack jutsu, a technique given to him by the Mangekyou Sharingan!\n\nKakashi managed to implode Deidara's right arm rendering his ability to use clay attacks almost powerless. Naruto then managed to partially destroy the bird. Deidara jumped away to hide and marveled at Naruto's jinchuuriki strength. Feeling cocky Deidara failed to see the real Naruto sneak up behind him and give him a crushing punch across the face. Naruto then began to pummel the injured Deidara but the Akatsuki member managed to escape quickly using Kawarimi.\n\nDeidara then spied on his opponents and saw Sakura and Chiyo return to the group, having vanquished Sasori. Deidara was surprised that two pathetic ninja were able to take out such an \"art\" master. Deidara moved to flee but was stopped by Team Guy. Seeing the chances of escape grim, Deidara bolted to the clay bird and bit off a huge chunk with his real mouth. Ingesting the clay Deidara focused chakra to his stomach and activated the explosive clay, causing a huge explosion in a suicide move. The quick thinking of Kakashi allowed him to use his implosion technique one more time to suck away Deidara before his explosion could injure the group.\n\nThinking the battle won the teams left the area. Afterwards a figured emerged from the ground, it was Deidara who was forced to use his last ditch exploding mud bunshin to get away. He then went on a journey to find his sucked away arm. He finally found his arm in the company of Zetsu and his associate Tobi. Deidara had a tit for tat relationship with Tobi and was annoyed by the man's eagerness and jests. Deidara got his arm back, but not before having to leg strangle Tobi for his annoying statements.\n\nA short time later Tobi was officially admitted into the group and he was partnered with Deidara. Deidara traveled with Tobi as he was directed to capture the Sanbi turtle demon. Though Tobi himself was supposed to go it alone, he helped the new recruit subdue the demon. Deidara did his part to show Tobi the ropes, but Tobi responded by merely snoozing through his diatribes.\n\nDeidara next set his sights on Sasuke, the man who took out Orochimaru. With Tobi at his side, Deidara witnessed Sasuke first attack Tobi, who clumsily got in Sasuke's way and ended up being cut down but survived, somehow. Noting Sasuke's speed, Deidara first tested him with simple exlpoding clay spiders, but found himself outclassed. Teaming up with Tobi for his next attack and using a more powerful variety of explosive chakra, Deidara took to the skies on a clay dragon, attacking from the air while Tobi littered the ground with explosive clay mines. However, Sasuke's ingenuity led Deidara to Deidara crash into his own minefield. Angered, Deidara used his most powerful form of exploding clay to make a gargantuan duplicate of himself that scattered trillions of microscopic clay explosives, which when inhaled, traveled through the body and exploded, cell by cell, until the target simply dissolved into thin air. Deidara watched in amusement as Sasuke seemed to vanish slowly into nothingness, but Sasuke appeared behind him and stabbed him, non-lethally with Chidori and revealed his dissolving demise to be Genjutsu. However, Deidara then collapsed into clay and a hand belonging to the real Deidara emerged to grab Sasuke by the ankle, revealing that due to an encounter with Itachi years earlier, he had developed a resistance to Genjutsu in his left eye.\n\nTrapping Sasuke in a full-body tomb of explosive clay, Deidara descended, but Sasuke tore it open and pursued him with a Chidori as Deidara detonated it. The two landed, with Deidara's victory once again snatched away from him as Sasuke used the Sharingan and his knowledge of elemental weaknesses to defuse all Deidara's clay Earth bombs with his Lightning based Chidori jutsu. With one last act, Deidara revealed his ultimate art, exposing a mouth on his chest like the one on his palms and feeding it a lump of clay. With apologies to Tobi, he then transformed himself into an explosive that covered the land for miles around, reaching high into the sky and once more proclaiming �Art is a bang!�. Deidara died happily, blissfully unaware that Sasuke escaped, but also that he had become what was in his opinion the most perfect form of art.","imgPerso":"images/information/Deidara.jpg","imgVillage":"images/information/country/IwaMini.gif","characteristcs":{"First Manga Appearance:":"Chapter 247","First Anime Appearance:":"Shippuuden Episode 2","Name Meaning:":"Potentially based on Japanese myth, Dei=Mud","Hidden Village:":"Rock Village","Rank:":"Unknown (Probably Jounin)","Age:":"19","Notable Features:":"Has a mouth on the palm of each hand, An artist at heart","Notable Quotes:":"\"Art is a bang!\"","See also:":"Sasori"}},{"name":"Denka","description":"A cat trained in the ninja arts, Denka is the associate of Nekobaa.

The sand that protects Gaara is the work of the demon Shukaku. This demon was once said to be the living soul of a Sand priest, we now know it is one of the bijuu, a tailed demon of the ancient world. Kazekage had the bijuu imbued into  his unborn son Gaara by Sand Kunoichi Chiyo. Though Shukaku protects Gaara from harm, it has caused him deep emotional and psychological harm. Whenever Gaara sleeps, Shukaku begins to eat more and more away at Gaara's psyche. This has led Gaara to limit his sleep to try and protect whatever mental stability he has left. Seeing that Gaara was unable to control the incarnation when young, Kazekage ordered Gaara killed. The sand constantly protected Gaara though and foiled any attempt at assassination. Gaara has cursed his father and those in the village for what they have done to him but he still acts under their wishes to participate in the Chuunin Exam. It is during this period that Gaara begins to lose more of his mental stability, eventually fully giving himself to the demon and allowing its full large form to take shape, that of a Tanuki, or Raccoon-Dog. It is briefly allowed to run rampant on its own while Gaara engages in a forced sleep, but Naruto is able to wake and injure Gaara and Shukaku crumbled back into sand.\n\nAfter being injured Gaara and Naruto are near exhausted, Gaara remained motionless on the ground, only able to watch as Naruto summoned the strength to keep crawling towards Gaara to stop him from further hurting Sakura. Naruto explained to Gaara that he grew up in a similar fashion, that his life could have turned out the same had people not acknowledged and cared for him like Iruka and Naruto's fellow teammates. Naruto explained that one can become truly strong not by fighting for oneself, but for those precious to them. It was then Gaara was able to fully understand that he had been living his life in the wrong manner. Shortly thereafter Kankurou and Temari appeared to help Gaara. Gaara let them know he was finished fighting, and had the team retreat. As they made their way back to the Wind Country, Gaara did something surprising to both Temari and Kankurou, he apologized for hurting them in the past.\n\nAfter Sand had retreated the country discovered that they had been manipulated into invading Leaf by Orochimaru and not under the direction of their Kage. After conceding defeat, Sand and Leaf became allies again. Months later when Shikamaru and his Genin team went on a mission to retrieve Sasuke from the hands of Orochimaru, Tsunade requested a favor from the Sand Country. When Shikamaru and his team were in a dire situation, the three Sand Genin returned to lend assistance to their allies the Leaf. Gaara assisted Rock Lee in fighting Sound ninja Kimimaro. Kimimaro went to his limits and would have surely killed Gaara, had his sickness not got the better of him and ended his life.\n\nIn the period after, Gaara ascended to the position of Kazekage some time after the death of the former Kage, his father. With a less hostile and more stable personality, he was welcomed by his people and popular, although it was later revealed that he and every Kazekage before him were more like figureheads with the village's council acting more in the administrative department. Gaara was attacked by Akatsuki member Deidara and sacrificed his own safety to protect the village when Deidara threatened to reduce it to rubble. He was taken to Akatsuki's base in the River Country and through a complicated process, had Shukaku removed from him. However, as with all victims of the process, he was killed by it. His corpse was kept by Deidara as a trophy, but Naruto and Kakashi defeated him and retrieved it, where Chiyo gave up her life-force to resurrect him. It should be noted that despite the Shukaku bound to him, Gaara is still able to control sand with his own chakra.","imgPerso":"images/information/Gaara.jpg","imgVillage":"images/information/country/SunaMini.gif","characteristcs":{"First Manga Appearance:":"Chapter 35","First Anime Appearance:":"Naruto Episode 20","Name Meaning:":"\"Self-Loving\" ra=Kanji used in demons of myth","Hidden Village:":"Sand Village","Rank:":"Kazekage","Age:":"16","Jounin Master:":"Baki","Signature Abilities:":"Sabaku Kyuu, Sabaku Sousou","Notable Features:":"Kanji tattoo on forehead saying \"Love,\" Carries large gourd on his back","Notable Quotes:":"\"Love only yourself, and fight only for yourself.\"","See also:":"Temari, Kankurou, Baki, Kazekage","Character Appreciation:":""}},{"name":"Gamabunta","description":"A toad trained in the ninja arts, Gamabunta is a personal summon.\nClick For Quick-Spoilers:Gamabunta is the personal summon of Jiraiya and Naruto.

Striking quickly, Naruto punches all three of the Rain Genin.\n\nTaking one last stand, the Rain Genin Oboro uses a mist clone technique to create multiple clones of his Genin team. Naruto states that one must be the real version so he begins to attack the clones. Passing through them Naruto is unable to find any real physical bodies. Sasuke uses his Sharingan to see that none of the clones in front of them are real. Seeing Kabuto and Naruto off guard, the real Rain Genin rise from the ground and attack Kabuto. Kabuto is injured and they are surprised when they see Kabuto show a great deal of power behind his anger at being hurt.

He has been seen to direct the actions of other members.\nClick For Quick-Spoilers:Pain was a Hidden Rain missing-nin who was rumored to come from the Fuuma clan, note this is a different clan than the one located in the Rice Field Country. Pain was once a young Rain orphan named Nagato. During his youth in the war torn Rain Country, he met fellow orphans Konan and Yahiko. Nagato was a quiet child who admired Yahiko's desire to improve their living conditions and bring some justice to the world. Nagato and his companions met the Sannin following the war with the Rain Village. Jiraiya took a liking to the children and stayed behind to look after them. Jiraiya was surprised to learn that the emotional and quiet Nagato was a wielder of the Rinnegan, the venerated Doujutsu once possessed by Rikudou Sennin, the man regarded as the original modern shinobi.\n\nNagato and Yahiko were accosted by a vagrant Rock Ninja, and Yahiko moved to defend them. He was defeated and Nagato went into a berserk rage, quickly killing the ninja. Nagato was shocked when he finally regained control and Jiraiya promised to train the orphans so they could defend themselves. Nagato had trouble dealing with the way he reacted to the Rock ninja and Jiraiya explained that he shouldn't feel ashamed, as he was defending his friend. And that knowing what it feels like to be hurt is the reason why humans are kind to others. Nagato wondered how he could become like that and Jiraiya explained it just came with age. Nagato then promised to keep his friends safe, no matter what pain he had to experience. Three years passed and the trio were soon skilled enough to defeat one of Jiraiya's Kage Bunshin. He explained his time with them had ended and that hard times would still be ahead for them. But by working together they could change things, as they had finally grown up.\n\nOver the following years the trio entered many battles and rumors emerged that they may have died. Nagato continued to develop his skills and his Doujutsu and took on the name of \"Pain\". As Pain, Nagato began to gather other disenfranchised Rain shinobi and start a civil war with Hidden Rain. This apparently was a plan in line with Yahiko's expressed goals. Though Rain was led by legendary ninja Sanshouuo no Hanzou, Pain managed to kill Hanzou. He did not stop with merely Hanzou though, for he killed Hanzou's family, friends and associates; essentially taking down Hidden Rain all by himself. And though Pain had followers, they never saw Pain personally. His abilities, appearance and heartless nature thus fueled rumors about his identity. This also caused his followers to revere him as a god. In this position he operated out of the tallest tower in the Rain Country industrial city. In this tower he also maintained a secret room containing six mysterious beds, five of which held figures in Akatsuki cloaks.\n\nSome years before Pain also became a part of the Akatsuki organization. Konan joined as well, and was one of the few living persons aware of Pain's past. In this position she had seen him fight many battles and believed that he had never once lost in battle. She and his followers were also aware of his ability to control the rain which fell around their location. This he apparently did on schedule, so when rain fell on other days, his followers knew something was on his mind. This rain also had the ability to detect the chakra of opponents and allow Pain himself to feel their presence.\n\nDuring the Akatsuki meetings, Pain was adamant that the group could fulfill their desires if they possessed the bijuu. In his position as leader, he was shown to use a Shouten technique, which allowed the group members to take over the sacrificed body of another in exchange for some measure of their chakra. He also was responsible for summoning the huge King of Hell statue which holds the spirits of bijuu withdrawn from Jinchuuriki.\n\nPain has stated the group's ultimate goal is to control the world, but this may actually be a smokescreen, as Pain has been seen to report to Tobi in secret. Tobi directed Pain to capture Naruto personally in his role as leader, which apparently drew out an emotional response from Pain in the form of rain. Pain has officially told the group their goals can be accomplished through three steps. Step One is for the group to attain money. Step Two is to create the first mercenary group. Shinobi villages make money for their country, and for the money to be steady it requires war. Because there have not been any large scale wars in approximately the last decade, the ninja villages were being reduced in size. The Five Great Shinobi Villages could handle the downtrend, but the smaller villages could not. Akatsuki will form their own fighting force with no country allegiance. With this force they will undercut all the other villages and fight their battles for cheap. Then using the bijuu they can create new battles and new wars and gain a monopoly over the whole market. In the end they plan to control all the wars and be powerful enough to even collapse the shinobi villages of the large countries, forcing them to rely on Akatsuki as well. With all that in hand, the group can achieve Step Three, to control the world. Whether this aspect of the plan is true or not is unclear.","imgPerso":"images/information/AkatsukiLeader.jpg","imgVillage":"images/information/country/AmeMini.gif","characteristcs":{"First Manga Appearance:":"Chapter 363","First Anime Appearance:":"Shippuuden Episode 114","Hidden Village:":"Rain","Rank:":"Unknown (Kage Level Skill)","Notable Features:":"Wears multiple piercings","Character Appreciation:":""}},{"name":"Nidaime Raikage (Second LightningShadow)","description":"Nidaime Raikage was the second Raikage of Hidden Cloud.

He was master of puppet making who was responsible for the design of the puppets Kankurou uses today. One of his underlings was a Sand ninja named Yuura. When Sasori fled Sand to join Akatsuki, he placed a jutsu on his underling Yuura to cause him to unknowingly gather information and serve as a sleeper agent. When the time came, Yuura would be activated to do his masters bidding. This same jutsu was used on a young Yakushi Kabuto, who was to gather information on Sasori's former partner Orochimaru and his Fuushi Tensei technique. Orochimaru removed the memory block though and Kabuto chose to willingly side with Orochimaru.\n\nAfter the time skip, Sasori and his partner Deidara came to Hidden Sand to capture the one-tail demon Shukaku. Waiting outside Hidden Sand, Sasori activated Yuura. Yuura then wiped out some of the Sand's defenses, allowing Deidara to infiltrate and attack Gaara. After Gaara was captured, Kankurou chased after his brothers captor and met up with Sasori. When Kankurou tried to stop Deidara, Sasori revealed his true origin for the first time and fought Kankurou. Kankurou was outmatched by the master of puppets and he was defeated and poisoned by him. In the battle it was revealed the tail and other portions of Sasori's body were puppet pieces.\n\nSasori and Deidara returned to the Akatsuki cave base and participated in the extraction of the Shukaku demon from Gaara. Naruto and fellow teammates arrived in an attempt to stop the process but they did not make it in time. Sasori was faced by his grandmother Chiyo and Sakura. Chiyo's battle smarts and Sakura's power were enough to destroy Sasori's current form, that of the puppet Hiruko.\n\nSasori revealed he kills his opponents and turns them into puppets. This process was done 298 times in the past and his two female opponents would make 300. With Hiruko destroyed, Sasori revealed his greatest triumph, the puppet form of a man who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances, Hidden Sands own Sandaime Kazekage. Another surprise waiting for the two kunoichi, was Sasori's \"real\" form, a young man unaffected by time, appearing in the same form he was 20 years previously.\n\nSasori would use Sandaime's Satetsu abilities against the two kunoichi. His ability to make humans into \"hitokugutsu\" (literally human puppets) would allow him to use their abilities at life even in puppet form. Chiyo revealed her hand as well, summoning Sasori's very parents who were made into puppets as well when he was younger. Sasori used Sandaime to form the iron sand into spikes, and weapons. The puppets exchanged blows, eventually disabling the parent puppets. Chiyo and Sakura tried to avoid damage, but Sakura got scratched, forcing her to use one of their two poison antidotes. This gave Sakura the surprise opportunity though to destroy the Sandaime puppet. Sasori was then forced to remove his cloak and show his true abilities.\n\nSasori revealed he had made himself into a puppet, adding deadly weapons to his frame. Sakura managed to strike his body but it only managed to reform around a cylinder marked with the \"Scorpion\" kanji. Chiyo was forced to summon her ten Chikamatsu puppets, and Sasori in turn summoned his special hundred. The huge puppet fight began and Sakura managed to pin Sasori's body to the cave wall with the help of one of Chiyo's chakra sealing puppet parts. Missing though was Sasori's chest container, where his human essence lived. One of his broken puppets rose to reveal the container implanted inside. Weapon in hand it rushed for Chiyo but Sakura jumped in the way to take the lethal strike. Using her remaining strength, Chiyo secretly moved the parent puppets from either side to pierce Sasori's chest container, striking an apparently fatal blow.\n\nThe dying Sasori mocked the kunoichi and their reliance on physical forms. He told the two how he had escaped emotion and physical death with his transference to the container form. He then decided to offer the two kunoichi some information as a reward for beating him. He told them he was to meet with an underling of his who is acting as a spy in Orochimaru's camp. In ten days, on a bridge in the Grass Country they were to meet. With that, Sasori fell to the ground alongside his parents, dead. Sakura congratulated Chiyo for defeating Sasori, but Chiyo made a sad revelation. Sasori recognized the parents were going to strike, but he hesitated and did not move to avoid the attack. Sasori was not yet beyond emotion as he so claimed, he seemingly desired one final embrace from his parents.\n\nThe Leaf would use the information Sasori provided and travel to the Grass Country. When they arrived at the bridge, Leaf ninja Yamato would transform and impersonate Sasori in his Hiruko puppet. The Leaf watched in surprise as the spy was revealed as Kabuto.

Within the ANBU corps, he created and led the training division known as \"Ne\" or Root, which was detached from the main ANBU. The Root group was disbanded and he lost his position. He still is a power player though, with his own influence within the village.\nClick For Quick-Spoilers:Approximately fifty years before the series start, Danzou took part in a mission under the Nidaime Hokage which brought him into conflict with ninja from Hidden Cloud. With Cloud in pursuit, Danzou and his team of Akimichi Torifu and Uchiha Kagami along with Sarutobi Hiruzen, Homura Mitokado and Utatane Koharu were faced with a fatal choice. One person was to remain behind to delay the Cloud while the others escaped. Facing inner turmoil and unable to get the words out to volunteer, Danzou was ashamed at himself when Hiruzen did so without flinching. All through his life Danzou had felt one step behind Hiruzen, never able to catch up or surpass him. Danzou tried to argue that he would sacrifice himself instead, just as his father and grandfather once did. The Nidaime Hokage told the two young men it was not their time, and declared that Hiruzen would be the Sandaime Hokage the next day, as he himself would remain behind. Danzou would carry his grudge towards Hiruzen onwards in life, never feeling he had caught up to his old friend. Over time Danzou would form his own ninja force Root, which would act in Konoha's best interest from the shadows.\n\nSome years later, Hidden Rain was experiencing internal strife. Danzou aligned himself with Rain leader Hanzou in an attempt to put down the Rain ninja seeking peace. Several years later, Danzou and the Leaf elders attempted to put down the Uchiha insurrection by directing Itachi to wipe out his clan. At some point around this time, Danzou had surgery performed on his body by Orochimaru, which granted him the mind controlling Sharingan of Uchiha Shisui in his right eye, numerous other Sharingan eyes in his right arm and the genetic material of Shodai Hokage, which allowed him to use Shodai's unique powers.\n\nAfter Naruto returned to Konoha after two and a half years, Danzou used his influence to get his Root operative Sai onto the team heading to Hidden Grass to meet Sasori's spy. Sai acted against Danzou's orders but Danzou directed the young man to remain in Team 7 and continue watching Naruto. When Pain attacked the village, Danzou moved to prevent Naruto from returning and falling in the hands of Akatsuki. Naruto eventually returned and defeated Pain. In the aftermath, Tsunade fell into a coma from healing so many injured villagers. When the Fire Daimyou called for suggestions on who should be the new Hokage, Danzou scoffed at the notion that Hatake Kakashi was fit for the job. Using the mind controlling powers of Shisui's Sharingan, Danzou suggested he alone was suited for the position. The Daimyou agreed and Danzou became acting Hokage pending approval from the Jounin of the village.\n\nWith his new position as Hokage, Danzou directed Root to pull back on some of their operations, all to minimize his chances of losing Jounin support. He then traveled with two Root members to attend the Kage summit called by the Raikage. On the way to the summit, Danzou was attacked by remnants of the Hannya clan, who Root had nearly wiped out in the past. Danzou used the opportunity to use Shisui's eye. He quickly wiped out the attackers and went to the summit. There he revealed that Uchiha Madara was probably directing Akatsuki. When Mifune, the summit moderator, suggested that an alliance between the Five Great Shinobi Villages was needed, he suggested Konoha and Danzou take command, as they were the sole village left with a Jinchuuriki. This suggestion was agreeable to the always scheming Danzou.\n\nThings quickly turned against him when it was discovered he was again using Shisui's eye to gain Mifune's approval. Uchiha Sasuke soon arrived seeking revenge for Danzou's part in authorizing the Uchiha massacre. Danzou and his Root bodyguards fled and Sasuke went in pursuit. With the aid of Madara, Sasuke located Danzou and the two did battle. Using Shodai's genetic material and the Sharingans on his arm, Danzou revealed his Mokuton powers and Sharingan's Izanagi ability. This legendary Kinjutsu allowed the Sharingan user to make reality nothing but an illusion at the cost of permanently losing ones eye ability. Because of the numerous number of Sharingan on his arm, Danzou was able to negate many fatal attacks launched against him. Unfortunately as the fight wore on, Sasuke and his teammate Karin deduced how Izanagi worked and use this against Danzou, fooling him into thinking he had an viable Sharingan to utilize when he did not. Struck fatally, Danzou thought back over his past and failure to become a full Hokage like Hiruzen. With a promise to protect Konoha and the ninja world from the Uchiha, Danzou released a reverse seal on his chest. As the seal began to suck in the surrounding matter, Sasuke and Madara fled to avoid its power. Danzou's life was over, having failed to stop Sasuke from continuing on towards Konoha.","imgPerso":"images/information/Danzou.jpg","imgVillage":"images/information/country/KonohaMini.gif","characteristcs":{"First Manga Appearance:":"Chapter 281","First Anime Appearance:":"Shippuuden Episode 32","Name Meaning:":"Shi=Intention, plan, resolve mura=village; Dan=Group, steps zou=Storehouse, hide, possess","Hidden Village:":"Leaf Village","Rank:":"Unknown (Probable Jounin)","Age:":"72","Notable Features:":"Bandages over his right eye","See also:":"Sai"}},{"name":"Shiranui Genma","description":"A Jounin from the villaga of Konoha, Genma is the examiner for the third Chunin exam test.\nClick For Quick-Spoilers:When the villages of Hidden Sand and Sound begin to invade Konoha, the Jounin master Baki from Sand challenges Genma to fight him.

When Karura became pregnant and had Shukaku imbued into her son, she cursed the village for what they had done. When Gaara was later born she lost her life in the process. Gaara grew up confused and angry at his place in the village, as all the villagers feared him and his power to control the sands. When Gaara grew older he gained the ability to enter into a forced sleep, which would allow Shukaku to come out. Shukaku would gather sand from the surrounding area to make his large tanuki body. Shukaku seems to be fairly loud and flamboyant in his speech, probably as a result of not being released very often.\n\nThe Akatsuki criminal organization sought to obtain Shukaku from Gaara for their own diabolical ends.

Ever since he was a young boy, Mizuki had always despised the weak. Seeking to remove any such hinderances, he would even go so far as to secretly kill an injured comrade on a mission, just so they would not have to worry about finding him medical attention. Shortly before the start of the series, Mizuki was on a mission when he was met by Orochimaru. Orochimaru placed a formula onto Mizuki's skin in the form of a skull tattoo. The formula was one of Orochimaru's many experiements he had worked on while in Konoha. As a result, Mizuki sought to gain favor with Orochimaru for the \"gift\".\n\nAfter Naruto had failed the graduation exam he told Naruto of another way to graduate. He tricked Naruto into stealing the forbidden scroll of seals. Iruka discovered Mizuki's ambition and attempted to stop him. Mizuki told Naruto that the reason everyone hated him was because he had the Kyuubi inside him. He was about to kill Naruto when Iruka jumped in front of the large shuriken Mizuki had thrown.

During the next year he would spend his time training and planning his revenge. Approximately a year after incarceration, Mizuki made moves to break out.

Mizuki knocked her out, ignoring her pleas.\n\nMizuki traveled to the Nara clan medicinal compound where he broke in and stole the needed ingredients for his formula. He then traveled to a secret cave lab, where he was able to mix the ingredients. After ingesting the compound, he was given a burst of power. His body changed to resemble that of a tiger, and gave him more power than ever before. The formula was revealed to have spliced the genetic traits of animals in with humans. Naruto and Iruka who had been tracking down Mizuki began to battle him. They were no match for Mizuki at first, but Mizuki's power soon was exhausted after a Naruto Rasengan. Like all of Orochimaru's test subjects, Mizuki was a guinea pig, as the formula was not perfected. Mizuki was left a shriveled and broken man, less powerful than he had ever been before.

When she was young she was a talkative tom boy. When she grew up her beauty, personality and Ninjutsu became known to many. It was this very personality and Ninjutsu skill which she would pass on to Naruto. When she was young, she was brought to Konoha to be the next Kyuubi Jinchuuriki. Having a similar strong chakra like the existing Kyuubi Jinchuuriki Uzumaki Mito, Kushina was viewed as the ideal replacement. Kushina felt a crushing loneliness associated with bearing that burden, but Mito helped console her by stating she should fill her heart with love. If she would do that, she would live a happy life.\n\nDuring this time her classmates at the Academy made fun of her striking long, red hair. She would have none of such talk, and mercilessly beat them down. This gave her the nickname \"Red Hot-Blooded Habanero\". When ninja from Hidden Cloud attempted to abduct her, no tracking ninja from Konoha were able to locate her. One ninja did however, young classmate Namikaze Minato. Easily finding the strands of hair Kushina was leaving behind, he revealed it was easy to find such a lovely marker. From that day Kushina was proud of her hair and had fallen in love. With Minato's love, Kushina was able to fill her heart with love as Mito directed, and live a happy life in Konoha. She would later marry Minato and become pregnant with his child.\n\nWhen Jiraiya visited the couple during the pregnancy, he allowed Minato to read one of his latest books, a semi-biographical account of Jiraiya's own life. The character in the story was known for his drive and determination. For that reason Minato asked Jiraiya if he would mind if he named his own son \"Naruto\" after the character in the story. Kushina offered her approval of the name choice. Jiraiya was embarrassed and honored. During this time, the seal holding the Kyuubi within Kushina began to weaken. This was a known side-effect for pregnancy Jinchuuriki mothers. So as done with Mito before her, Sandaime Hokage directed his wife Biwako and ANBU guards to help protect Kushina as she gave birth outside of the village.\n\nBehind a barrier in a cave, Kushina was able to give birth as Minato worked on strengthening the Bijuu seal. The proud parents welcomed Naruto into the world and then set about fully setting the Kyuubi seal. Unfortunately at that same moment, a masked man entered the cave, having killed the ANBU and Biwako. Taking Naruto hostage, he directed Minato to step away from Kushina so he could have the Kyuubi for his own ends. Kushina would later perish, but because she added her chakra to the Kyuubi seal on Naruto, she was able to later speak with him as he worked on taming the Kyuubi once and for all.","imgPerso":"images/information/Kushina.jpg","imgVillage":"images/information/country/KonohaMini.gif","characteristcs":{"First Manga Appearance:":"Chapter 382","First Anime Appearance:":"Shippuuden Episode 128","Name Meaning:":"Uzumaki=\"Whirlpool\", Kushina=A name","Hidden Village:":"Leaf Village","Rank:":"Unknown (Probably Jounin)","Notable Features:":"Known as the \"Red Hot-Blooded Habanero\""}},{"name":"Uzumaki Mito","description":"Uzumaki Mito was a kunoichi highly skilled in Fuuinjutsu.

Later when Hidan and Kakuzu captured the Nibi Jinchuuriki Ni'i Yugito, Zetsu arrived to take on the duty of returning her body to their base of operations. After several of the Akatsuki members fell in battle, the remaining survivors were Tobi and Zetsu. Though Tobi portrayed himself as being Uchiha Madara, it was revealed he was Uchiha Obito. White Zetsu had history with Obito, having helped the boy recover after falling in battle. It was then revealed that White Zetsu was made by Uchiha Madara from the genetic material of Senju Hashirama amplified by the power of the Gedou Mazou statue. White Zetsu was then cloned through buds from the Gedou Mazou root system. One of these clones combined with Obito when he learned that his former teammates Rin and Kakashi was in trouble. Upon seeing Rin being killed by Kakashi, Obito lost control. Through being combined with the Senju power, Obito awakened his own full abilities. When Obito decided to help Madara carry out his plans, Madara formed his dark chakra-like \"will\" into the being which would become the Black Zetsu half. The now full Zetsu would assist Obito as he carried out his duties in the guise of \"Madara\".\n\nYears later, the two men would carry out the Fourth Great Ninja War with the help of Yakushi Kabuto. His assistance allowed for the creation of thousands of White Zetsu clones. These clones could communicate over short distances telepathically and served as the main bulk of the Akatsuki forces. The original White Zetsu was left behind to watch over Sasuke, who had received his brother's eyes. Upon recovery, Sasuke tested out his new powers by killing the original White Zetsu. Black Zetsu was later neutralized in battle by Choujuurou.","imgPerso":"images/information/Zetsu.jpg","characteristcs":{"First Manga Appearance:":"Chapter 234","First Anime Appearance:":"Naruto Episode 134","Name Meaning:":"\"Tongue\" or \"Reed\" (A form of tall hollow grass or tongue attachment to a hollow woodwind instrument)","Hidden Village:":"-","Notable Features:":"Strange fly-trap-like extensions which cover his upper body, His main torso is split into light and dark halves"}},{"name":"Zouri","description":"Personal hired mercenary to Gat�.\nClick For Quick-Spoilers:Gat� ordered the partners Waraji and Zouri to grab Tazuna's daughter as a hostage.
